# Neural Network: Wine Classification

Using the Keras framework, I've built a neural network that classifies wines from wine.csv file into one of 3 possible categories (customer_segment). 

Results were plotted as a confusion matrix (3x3 matrix).

I've explored concepts seen in classroom such as data standardization, dimensionality reduction and others, in order to achieve an accuracy greater than 80% accuracy per class.
